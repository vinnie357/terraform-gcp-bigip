# New VPC with 3-nic BIG-IP

**Note:** This example creates a random, temporary password for the BIG-IP which is stored in the Terraform state file.  This is not a good practice for production environments.  Ideally, you would use a random password generated by the Secrets Manager API.

## Usage
To run this example run the following commands:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve 
```

**Note:** this examples deploys resources that will cost money.  Please run the following command to destroy your environment when finished:
```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
## creds

```bash
project="myproject"
gcloud config set project $project
gcloud auth application-default login
```
